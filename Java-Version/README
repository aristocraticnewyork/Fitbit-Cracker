# Java-Version

You can compile the project yourself or just navigate to out/artifacts to find the jar and then launch it.

Actually what does it do:

It takes the account in accounts.txt and test them if they are working or not on the fitbit login page.
You will need proxies for that because fitbit bans ips.
For that you create a proxies.txt and you put every proxies in it like the exemple on this repository.

When you launch the .jar, the accounts and proxies must be in the same folder.

# To-Come

Multi-threading, GUI interface, better handling of proxies (maybe automatic no more txt files)
